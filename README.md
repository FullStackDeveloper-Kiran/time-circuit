# DeLorean Time Circuits

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/josetxu/pen/jOadxEK](https://codepen.io/josetxu/pen/jOadxEK).

I started with the idea of ​​just doing the time clocks and then I thought it would be nice to add the keypad to be able to input a destination time. Then I also added the pressure gauges and of course, everything had to be able to be turned on and off, so I added the manual switch for the time circuits, with some surprises behind it... and all enhanced with some sound effects.

Information:
------------

- **Drag & drop** to move the scene in 3D.
- **Mouse wheel** to zoom in-out.
- **Keyboard arrows** to center the scene.
- **ESC key** to reset the position of the scene.
- **Double click** to activate or deactivate the automatic animation  (you can drag & drop while it is active).
- Use the **numbers** on the keypad (+ button) or on your keyboard (+ enter) to input a destination time.
  - The correct format for time input is: **MMDDYYYYHHMM**
  - You can enter single values ​​following the order:
      - only month: **MM**
      - month and day: **MMDD**
      - and in the same way with year, hour and minute.
  - An incorrect time input will give an **error**.
      - any odd number input 
      - wrong month, day, hour or minute

Options:

You can show, hide or show layered each module separately:

- Gauges
- Time Clocks
- Keypad 
- Time Circuits Switch (which takes a bit longer).

Time Panels:
----------

The "Destination Time" tells you where you're going (a <a href="https://css-tricks.com/codepen-beta/">red letter date</a> in the history of internet).

The "Present Time" tells you where you're are (right now).

The "Last Departed Time" tells you where you're were (the moment I started with this idea).
